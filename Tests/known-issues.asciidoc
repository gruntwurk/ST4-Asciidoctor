This document contains some annotated examples of problematic syntax elements which need to be fixed, and for which there aren't any proper Sublime Text syntax tests yet.


== Literal Characters

Although the situation was greatly improved, there are still cases of valid literal characters occurrences being false-positively captured as if they were delimiters of some dual-delimited markup construct.

=== Literal Asterisks

The following paragraph contains a literal `*` which the syntax false-positvely matches as a bold delimiter:

calculate (4*3/2)*1

For more info and possible solutions, see https://github.com/tajmone/ST3-Asciidoctor/discussions/36[Discussion #36^].

=== Literal Hash Symbol

One of the most problematic chars is the `#` symbol which currently needs to be replace by the `&num;` SGML entity to prevent the syntax from highlighting it as an opening mark delimiter, which badly breaks the document since currently there's no bail-out at EOL mechanism for this element.
