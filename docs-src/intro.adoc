= Introduction

The goal of this Manual is to document the various features of the ST4-Asciidoctor package, serving as a reference guide, and at the same time try to illustrate how to maximize the benefits of the package by providing practical editing tips via usage guidelines.

To simplify learning for AsciiDoc or Sublime Text newbies, some technical terms contain links to their official documentation, so that they might be easily looked up for more information.

The Manual is still a work-in-progress in its early stages.
