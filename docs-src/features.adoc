|=============================================================================

The meaning of the table columns are:

[horizontal]
[.red]#Name# ::
The exact name of the snippet, for invoking it via the Command Palette.

[.red]#Trigger# ::
The snippet text trigger (if any).

[.red]#S#{nbsp}[_Selection_] ::
whether the snippets preserve or not the current selection (if any).

[.red]#W#{nbsp}[_Width_] ::
The width of elements which can be optionally represented my multiple characters, e.g. block delimiters.
In most cases, block delimiters generated via snippets are extended to 78 characters, for decorative purposes.

[.red]#Fields# ::
The list of extra supported fields (if any) which the user can navigate through via kbd:[Tab], usually holding some preset values.


== Completions

* Provides completions for attributes (built-in and locally defined) and cross references (local anchors and titles).


== Keymap Details


=== Comments

Both inline and block comments are support via the default Sublime Text key bindings -- usually, kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Numpad /] and kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[Numpad /], respectively.


=== Auto-Paired Punctuation

* Asterisks (strong), underscores (emphasis), backticks (monospaced), English quotation marks, and Czech quotation marks are autopaired and will wrap selected text.
** If you start an empty pair and hit backspace, both elements are deleted.
** If you start an empty asterisks pair and hit kbd:[Space] or kbd:[Tab], the right element is deleted (because you probably wanted to start a list, not a strong text).


=== Lists and Callouts

* At the end of a list item (ordered or unordered), pressing kbd:[Enter] will automatically insert the new list item "`bullet.`"
** Pressing kbd:[Enter] on the blank list item will remove it.
** Pressing kbd:[Tab] on the blank list item, or selected item(s), will increase the nesting level and indent it.
** Pressing kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[Tab] on the blank list item, or selected item(s), will decrease nesting level and unindent it.
* At the end of a callouts list item, pressing kbd:[Enter] will automatically insert the new list item with an incremented number.
** Pressing kbd:[Enter] on the blank list item will remove it.

// @TODO: Explain how to disable lists indentation!

TIP: You can disable indentation of list items in your settings file.


== Symbols Indexing

This section illustrates how the package handles {ST_SymbolsIndexing} and the various Goto functionality associated with it:

[horizontal]
Local symbols ::
i.e symbols in the current document -- accessible via:
* _Menu_: menu:Goto[Goto Symbol...]
* _Keyboard_: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[R]/kbd:[Cmd]+kbd:[R]

Global{nbsp}symbols ::
i.e symbols in the current project -- accessible via:
* _Menu_: menu:Goto[Goto Symbol in Project...]
* _Keyboard_: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[R]/kbd:[Cmd]+kbd:[Shift]+kbd:[R]

=== Section Titles

Document and section titles are displayed in both the local and global _Goto Symbol_ lists:

* In the local symbol list, titles are nicely indented according to hierarchy.
* In the global symbol list, titles are prefixed with `=` characters (as in the AsciiDoc source), which allows to quickly filter them out by typing `=`, as well as providing an easy visual cue to identify them.

////
// This is no longer true with ST4:
Furthermore, they will be on top of the list because of the precedence of `=`.
