ST4-Asciidoctor v0.1.2
======================

Changes to the package...


Syntax Fixes
------------

How this update improves syntax highlighting AsciiDoc sources.


### Fixed Broken Example Blocks

This update fixes a bug in example blocks where curly quotes would result in
prematurely popping-out of the example context, causing the closing block
delimiter to be treated as a new opening example block, jeopardizing syntax
highlighting of the rest of the document.

This was the most annoying bug in the package, leading to documents
highlighting and scoping frequently breaking up.


### Attributes List Lines

The `attribute_list_line` context, which had been temporarily disabled while
disentangling the original syntax, has now been reintroduced.

Besides adding syntax highlighting for this element, its reintroduction also
fixes a known problem where block attributes-lists contents were triggering
false positive matches for inline quote elements, e.g. capturing as a
superscript delimiter the caret in the `cols` table attribute `<.^h` of the
following example:

    [cols="<.^h,<.<a"]
    |=============================

These false positives would jeopardize syntax highlighting the rest of the
document, or large portions of it. There was already a temporary workaround
to this problem, but it only handled table specific attributes-list, whereas
the `attribute_list_line` context should handle all edge-cases.
