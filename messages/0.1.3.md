ST4-Asciidoctor v0.1.3
======================

Changes to the package...


Syntax Branching
----------------

This release enables the _syntax branching_ feature of Sublime Text 4, which
greatly improves handling syntax highlighting of malformed quotes in AsciiDoc
sources by gracefully recovering and this preventing documents break-up.


Syntax Improvements
-------------------

Thanks to @polyglot-jones for adding support for new AsciiDoc elements and
improving existing ones:

- Admonition inline labels
- Attribute references
- Bibliographic anchors
- Callout definitions
- Characters escapes
- Cross reference links
- Definition list items
- Double escaping of unconstrained delimiters
- Index terms
- Ordered list items
- Typographic/curly quotes
- XML/SGML entities (named and numeric)


Dedicated Color Scheme
----------------------

Welcome **AsciiDoc Dark**, a dedicated (dark) color scheme, tailored to cover
AsciiDoc syntax scopes and designed with documentation editing in mind.

This color scheme (enabled by default) brings to life all the supported
AsciiDoc elements â€” most of which have scope names not covered by generic
schemes. Color combinations where carefully chose in order to allow keeping
track of the various elements without being overwhelmed by too many color
contrasts on the "page".


Build System Presets
--------------------

@polyglot-jones contributed AsciiDoc build presets targeting:

- **HTML** (requires Asciidoctor)
- **EPUB** (requires Asciidoctor-EPUB3 too)
- **DOCX** (requires pandoc too)
